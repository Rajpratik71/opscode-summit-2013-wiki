Would like to talk about Test Kitchen, not a demo

Lots of people are using Test Kitchen

When is 1.0 coming out?  It could have been shipped 8 months ago.  Not a lot has changed.  Big hangup is documentation - want sufficient documentation ready before 1.0 release and reasonable documentation.  Fletcher doesn't scale to onboard people on to Test Kitchen.  Hopefully in the next week or so want to get docs ready.

Need to fix Chef Zero provisioner - Test Kitchen doesn't know it is available to it yet

Opscode merged a bunch of work to make Test Kitchen work better with non-Unix Linux to work better with bourne shell.  Using Test Kitchen to Juniper test network switches (JunOS is transactional).

## What will we do now?  What needs to happen next?
