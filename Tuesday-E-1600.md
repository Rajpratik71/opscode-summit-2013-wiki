## Summary of Discussions

Would like to talk about Test Kitchen, not a demo

Lots of people are using Test Kitchen

When is 1.0 coming out?  It could have been shipped 8 months ago.  Not a lot has changed.  Big hangup is documentation - want sufficient documentation ready before 1.0 release and reasonable documentation.  Fletcher doesn't scale to onboard people on to Test Kitchen.  Hopefully in the next week or so want to get docs ready.



## What will we do now?  What needs to happen next?
