## Summary of Discussions

Vagrant and Berkshelf have become the de-facto Chef development workflow, but it is not properly documented.

Plus, getting your Chef Development Workstation environment kinda blows with all these extra tools.

There's a whole mess of tools and it's hard for people who are new to Chef (or if you drop your laptop).  Have a shell script to setup the Chef cookbook-writing environment.

Problem hasn't been solved because people skip straight to implementation (wrapped in an MSI installer, utensils omnibus, etc.)

Would like to create a manifesto at a high level on what a Chef development environment should look like.  Want to define some specs for a Chef DevKit, define them and let it evolve.

Start of the manifesto:

* Should have defined product owners
* Should support all major OSes first-class: Win/Linux/Mac OS X
* Should cover everything prior to code commit (workstation)
* Should be packaged
* Should come packaged with testing tools
* Should prescribe workflow

Owners should be both in and outside Opscode - don't want a repeat of having the Opscode-recommended workflow that got blow of the water by Berkshelf/Jamie Winsor of Riot Games.
