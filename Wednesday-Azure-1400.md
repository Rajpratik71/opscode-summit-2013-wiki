## Summary of Discussions

Built web site from scratch, @Gap adopted Jenkins, using it to build systems and develop software

@Splunk have to recreate the build server environments repeatedly

Repo servers and proxying - how to get Splunk servers building in your environment, for example.  Containerize how to get Jenkins and so forth, like pypy & gems.
