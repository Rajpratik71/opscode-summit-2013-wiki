Build Systems
=============

## Convener

Rich @Splunk

## Participants

## Summary of Discussions

Built web site from scratch, @Gap adopted Jenkins, using it to build systems and develop software

@Splunk have to recreate the build server environments repeatedly

Two different approaches to defining tools:

* Central place to work for builds
* I want to build isolated on an airplane

How to integrate the two

Repo servers and proxying - how to get Splunk servers building in your environment, for example.  Containerize how to get Jenkins and so forth, like pypy & gems.

Security

Innovation in my current job - Create a single object defining a whole stack - different roles of spunk machines.  Plus add build rules.

Documentation

Promotion rules - QA team cutting release, manual steps for ops team to deploy.



## What will we do now?  What needs to happen next?

Go back to Opscode to provide a build service for the community to collectively improve
