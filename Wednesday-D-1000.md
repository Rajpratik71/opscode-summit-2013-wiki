## Summary of Discussions

#### What the Opscode Community can do:

Beginner area for how to help the community. List different areas:

* Code Review
* Documentation
* QA/Test etc.

Submit your code before you submit:

* Nice folks who check out your code before you throw it up on the
  community site
* Nice check yourself, make sure you're not being the asshole that
  drives others away, always constructive criticism

#### What individuals can do:

Expose yourself to the target group. Existing communities are
intimidating and the likelihood for imposter syndrome in marginalized
groups is high.

Volunteer to teach with these desired groups of folks

Setting up a curriculum that builds up to all the parts of chef i.e.

* Ruby
* Git Hub / Version control
* JSON
* Command line
* Community bug squashing.
* Build cookbooks

Need a list of many of the groups in the area, they're hungry for
people to teach

One on one mentoring. You don't have to change the world, boil the
ocean. Start small and make a difference for one person.

Find an advocate for you to help you break into the target groups.

## What will we do now? What needs to happen next?
