## Summary of Discussions
What Opscode Community can do:  
    Beginner area for how to help the community  
        List different areas:  
            Code Review  
            Documentation  
            QA/Test etc.  
    Submit your code before you submit:  
        Nice folks who check out your code before you throw it up  on the community site  
        Nice check yourself, make sure you're not being the asshole that drives others away, always constructive criticism  
 
 
What individuals can do:  
    Expose yourself to the target group:  
        You're big scary dudes.  It's less scary when we meet you... one at a time  
        Volunteer to teach with these desired groups of folks  
            Setting up a curriculum that builds up to all the parts of chef i.e.  
                * Ruby  
                * Git Hub / Version control  
                * JSON  
                * Command line  
                * Hack session and pull a bug from the community, work as a group to fix it and check it back in as a group.  You all win, and if the asshole blast occurs, it doesn't hurt as much  
                * Build cookbooks  
	    Need a list of many of the groups in the area, they're hungry for people to teach
        You don't have to change the world of women in engineering, you can change the world of engineering for one woman.  One on one mentoring.  
        Find an advocate for you to help you break into the target group - 'token lady friend'
