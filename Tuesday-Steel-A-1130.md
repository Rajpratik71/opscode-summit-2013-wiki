### Vagrant chef-solo to chef-zero
#### 
#### Summary of Discussions
* [Pull Request](https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/pull/2463) for supporting -z mode for chef-client with vagrant
* How does chef-client -z work? Path for specifying your configuration? - You can specify where everything lives in your knife.rb
* Using test-kitchen as a mechanism to stand up single instances is probably easier in the mean time. Unless you need multi-vm hosts test-kitchen will probably just work.
* vagabond for standing up clusters with lxc is a good alternative.
* [chef workflow](https://github.com/chef-workflow/chef-workflow) - makes it easy to have exact copies of environments. 
*
