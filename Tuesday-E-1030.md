#### Summary of Discussions
Jeff - Overview of the problems we face @rally - TDD, pushing cookbooks to hosted chef with each commit.

* What does TDD mean to us? Writing a failing test first.
* Using test kitchen for wiring tests, and chef spec as unit testing.
* At what level do you unit test a cookbook? - Try to unit test the logic not the declarations. 
* We are not all coders needs to be changed. Because of chef we all need to be coders.
* Team make up - How does team make up affect the IAC? 
* Agile has been fighting TDD for years and we should be embracing that discussion as well. 
* Chef Spec - What type of logic? - URL to zookeeper is one (if you have multiple clusters). 
* 



## What will we do now?  What needs to happen next?
