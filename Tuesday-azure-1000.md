Ruby 2.0 Support / Omnibus with Ruby 2.0

Versioned Attributes

Taking away Ruby 1.8.7 Support in Chef 12

Just use core JSON (Yagile in core Ruby)

Make error messages not terrible (at character 80 there was an error)

Fix JSON

Get rid of Yagile use core JSON

Yagile is seems to be abandonware

Does Ruby 2.0 work on Windows (When Ruby 2.0 first came out, compiled version of the libraries switched on 1.8 
to 1.9 binary compatibility, so existing gems didn't work until you compiled them yourself)

Chef 12 support in a post-container world (Docker LWRPs) - John Kaiser working on low-level machine abstraction

LXC components now namespaces, need to support that - route, ifconfig, etc.
