Multi-Node Testing and Vagabond
===============================

## Convener

## Participants

Frustration with working with Chef servers very far away

Tried using vagrant at first working locally

Then tried writing bash script to provision nodes

Doing that for awhile, seemed a lot faster, so converted this to a proper tool

Been around for a little while

Under the hood uses an LXC cookbook to provision a system - a lot of state for it to work
